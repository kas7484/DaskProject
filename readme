Dask Project

This project explores the use of Dask's delayed and futures API for parallel programming in Python. Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing that enables parallel computations on larger-than-memory datasets.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Dask installed on your system. You can find more information on installing Dask on the official Dask website.

Project Structure


To run the scripts, simply execute them with Python 3. You can specify the number of simulations to run for estimating π by passing an argument to the pi function. For example:


$ python3 futurepi.py 1000000
This will estimate π using 1,000,000 simulations.
